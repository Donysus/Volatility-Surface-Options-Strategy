# Volatility Surface Demo Notebook - Status

The notebook has been fully completed with all sections implemented.

## Completed Sections:

1. **Setup & Imports** - All libraries and modules imported
2. **Data Fetching** - SPY option chain retrieval and cleaning
3. **Calculate Implied Volatility** - Vectorized IV solver implementation
4. **Build Volatility Surface** - Cubic spline interpolation fitted
5. **Visualize Surfaces** - 2D smiles, 3D surface plots
6. **Calculate Greeks** - Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho for all options
7. **Implement Strategies** - Volatility Arbitrage and Gamma Scalping
8. **Backtest** - Portfolio simulation with position tracking
9. **Performance Analysis** - Sharpe, Sortino, drawdown, VaR metrics
10. **Summary & Conclusions** - Complete analysis summary

## Key Features Implemented:

- Modular, production-ready code
- Comprehensive error handling
- Caching for efficiency
- Professional visualizations (Matplotlib & Plotly)
- Full backtesting engine
- Advanced performance metrics
- Greeks visualization
- Strategy signal generation
- Real-time market data integration

## How to Use:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Open notebook: `jupyter notebook notebooks/volatility_surface_demo.ipynb`
4. Run cells sequentially from top to bottom
5. All modules are functional and tested

The notebook provides a complete end-to-end demonstration of volatility surface construction, options pricing, Greeks calculation, and quantitative trading strategies.
